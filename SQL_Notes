	4 Foreign Key: It is an attribute which is used to identify relationship of the table with some another table maintans data integriy.
	5 Composite Key: Any key with one or more attribute is known as composite key.
	6 Compound key: if a composite key has a attribute which is foreign key than it is compound key.
	7 surrogate key : if the table does not have any attribute which can uniquely identify the data than a key is formed which is known as surrogate key.

Create Database 
	CREATE DATABASE ROHAN;

DELETE Database
	DROP DATABASE ROHAN;

Use a particular database
	USE ROHAN;
		(name of the database)

Create Table
	CREATE TABLE test
	(
		test_column INT
	);

	Inside the bracket it is the name of the column along with it's datatypes.


Alter Table
	ALTER TABLE test
	ADD another_column VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL;

Order by - sort the data 
	Select * from Customer ORDER BY COUNTRY ASC | DSC



Basics:


SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


COUNT() Syntax

SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Unique Names :

The SQL LIKE Operator

SELECT * FROM Customers
